 * EventHandler class.

 * be defined in an adventure.
 *
 * When a game event is triggered during execution (usually during a command),
 * the game searches for a matching EventHandler and calls its run() method.
 *
 * The EventHandler objects should be instantiated in an adventure's "event-handlers" file.
