<p>You are in the outer chamber of the hall of the Guild of Free Adventurers. Many men and women are guzzling beer and there is loud singing and laughter.</p>
<p>On the north side of the chamber is a cubbyhole with a desk. Over the desk is a sign which says: <strong>&quot;REGISTER HERE OR ELSE!&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Behind the desk is a burly Irishman who looks at you with a scowl and asks, &quot;What's your name?&quot;</p>
<p>The guest book on the desk lists the following adventurers:</p>

      <p>The Irishman mentions something else to you. &quot;I see you're from the future, and you're visiting in a web browser. Normally, I keep my guest book inside your browser in something called 'local storage.' Your adventurers will live inside your browser and you can play as them any time you want, as long as you use the same computer and the same browser.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;If you want me to save your adventurers so you can play as them across multiple computers and browsers, you can 'log in with Facebook' and I'll keep them in the big guest book up in the clouds.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And don't worry. I know that you Free Adventurers might have colorful pasts and you might not want other people to know you're here. Here in Eamon, we never sell or give away any information about our adventurers, not even to our local armourer or wizard. Your information is safe here.&quot;</p>
