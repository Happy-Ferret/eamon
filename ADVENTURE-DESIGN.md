# Eamon Adventure Design Manual

So you want to build an Eamon adventure? This requires some basic knowledge of databases, JavaScript programming, and using a command-line terminal.

Eamon is built on ReactJS and Django, but you don't need in-depth knowledge about either to contribute. You can build an entire adventure with no programming if you use the built-in features. Or, to add custom special effects, all you need to know is a bit of JavaScript. (Eamon is written in TypeScript, which is just a fancier version of JavaScript and is easy to learn if you already know JavaScript.)

## Getting started
 
To design an adventure, you'll need to set up a local copy of Eamon. Thanks to Docker, this only takes a few easy steps.

First, install docker and docker-compose on your system:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

Docker is available for Linux, Windows 10, and MacOS.

Once Docker is installed, open a terminal and run the following command:

    docker-compose up -d

To load the base database, containing all currently published adventures, run:

    ./db/import.sh
    
Eamon will now be available at http://localhost:8000

The Adventure Designer is located at http://localhost:8000/admin

To create an account in the adventure designer, run the following:

    docker-compose run django python manage.py createsuperuser

### Running the unit tests

Eamon contains one set of tests for the core logic, and (optionally) one set of tests per adventure. These are all runnable using the Jest test runner.

The tests do depend on API calls, so the back-end must be running. (`python manage.py runserver`)

```
cd client
yarn test
```

To run just one test, you can specify the file name after `yarn test`. It must use forward slashes, even on Windows.

```
yarn test adventures/the-beginners-cave/event-handlers.spec.ts
```

To keep watching and compiling the Typescript files between test runs, the easiest way is to have two terminals open.
In the first terminal, kick off `yarn start` and leave it running. In the second terminal, run the tests via the commands
above. You can then edit some code and run the tests again to see the result.

### Manual setup

If you can't use Docker, or you prefer a manual installation, see the file ADVENTURE-DESIGN-MANUAL-SETUP.md for instructions.

## Building the adventure database

You can edit your adventure objects in the admin site. This provides basic forms for creating adventures, rooms, artifacts, monsters, etc. This is still a work in progress!

The adventure objects are defined in the following tables in the database:

	• Adventure_adventure
	• Adventure_room
	• Adventure_roomexit
	• Adventure_artifact
	• Adventure_effect
	• Adventure_monster
	• Adventure_hint
	• Adventure_hintanswer

First, create an Adventure. Give your adventure a name and a slug. Also give it a description and intro text. If you want to ask a question to the player on the intro screen, put the question in the `intro_question` field. Set the `active` field to 1.

The fields with names beginning with `EDX`, as well as the `first_hint` and `last_hint` fields, are used for importing data from the EDX databases. For new adventures, leave these blank.

### Adding rooms

From the admin dashboard, click "+ Add" next to "Rooms" to create a new room.

Fields are:

- Adventure: Choose the adventure you created above in the drop-down
- Room ID: Give it an ID number. Room 1 is the where the player will start. Typically, rooms are numbered sequentially starting with 1, though the program currently won't calculate this for you.
- Name
- Description - Unlike Classic Eamon, this can contain as much text as you like.
- Is Dark - Check this box if the room is dark and requires a light source

Room Exits

Each room typically has one or more exits, connecting it to other rooms.

Fields are:

- Direction: n, e, s, w, ne, se, sw, nw, u, d
- Room To: The room id of the destination room. Enter -999 for the exit to the main hall. Other negative numbers may be used for special connections. These will require a custom event handler.
- Door ID: If this connection is blocked by a door, enter the artifact ID of the door. Leave blank if there is no door.
- Message: currently unused

### Artifacts and monsters

Do the same for artifacts and monsters.

### Hints

If you want to provide special hints in your adventure, add these to the `adventure_hint` and `adventure_hintanswer` tables.


## Programming Custom Commands and Event Handlers

Make a copy of the folder "static/adventures/base-adventure". Name it the machine-friendly slug of your adventure (e.g., "the-beginners-cave").

You should have the following files:

    static/
        adventures/
            your-adventure/
                commands.ts
                event-handlers.ts

Note: These files need to exist for your adventure, even if they have no custom code in them.

If your adventure implements custom commands, edit commands.ts and add your new commands. Do not attempt to redefine any built-in commands here. To alter the effect of one of the built-in commands (READ, EAT, DRINK, etc.), use an event handler.

Edit event-handlers.ts. The base file already contains an event handler for the game start routine. Add any special effects or monster/artifact setup logic here.

The base file also contains an event handler for the effects of the POWER spell. Edit this to add any custom effects you want.

To add other custom logic, e.g., a special effect when picking up an artifact, reading a magic scroll, or drinking a potion of agility, you will need to add your own custom event handlers.

The following types of effects are built into the game and do not require custom code. For these, you only need to set up the appropriate data in the database:

* Reading signs and other artifacts that just provide text, with no effect on the player
* Edible and drinkable items, including healing potions
* Doors without keys
* Locked doors with keys
* Disguised monsters, such as the chest mimic in the Beginner's Cave
* Bound monsters, such as prisoners, who need to be freed
* Weapons
* Armor and other wearable items
    *  Any artifact of the "wearable" type can be worn by the player, but you will need to add custom event handlers if these should have any effect beyond changing the player's armor class
* Light sources, including ones that can run our of fuel
* Containers like chests, bags, and backpacks

### Event handler examples

There are dozens of different event handlers, each with its own unique implementation.
 
Examples include:
* Game start and custom variable initialization
* Movement and custom exit codes
* Using items
* Giving items to NPCs
* Attacking monsters (and being prevented from attacking)
* Setting off a trap when opening a container
* Random effects of the POWER spell
 
 See EVENT-HANDERS.md for full documentation and examples of each.

### Using custom game flags and data

Eamon has the ability to store custom game state which persists for the duration of the adventure. This is useful for keeping game flags and counters which affect the plot.

This is done by using the game.data object, which is just a string-indexed hash map.

Examples:

game.data["rising_water_level"] = 1;
game.data["deactivated the laser"] = false;

Commonly, this stores numbers and booleans, though it can also store strings, arrays, or any other JavaScript data types. The game data stored here is available in any of your event handlers and custom commands.

If you have used Eamon Deluxe, the `game.data` object replaces the `d%` variable, which was used in a similar fashion.

### Asking a question in the intro screen

If you add data to your "intro_question" field in your adventure, this will be asked to the player when they start the adventure. The player's answer will be available during the game in the game.intro_answer variable.

See the Devil's Dungeon for an example.

### Defining custom functions

If more than one of your event handlers use the same shared logic, you can define additional JavaScript functions at the end of your event-handlers.ts file. These can be called from anywhere within your event handlers. (See the Trollsfire routine in the Beginner's Cave for an example.)

## Automated testing

Eamon has a suite of tests which test both the core game logic and also the custom logic for many of the adventures. These tests use the Jest test framework and can be called from the terminal or PowerShell.

Make sure the Django development server is running, then run:

```
cd client
yarn test
```

Note: A couple of the tests can be a bit finicky and produce false positives. If you get a sporadic error, try running the tests again. 

Tests can also be run one file at a time, which is much faster than running the whole suite. To run a single test, append a filename to the command, like this:

```
yarn test adventures/the-beginners-cave/event-handlers.spec.ts
```

## Running your adventure

After you have created some rooms, artifacts, effects, and monsters, and created the "commands.ts" and "even-handlers.ts" files, it's time to give it a try.

Go to your browser and reload the Eamon tab. You should be able to load your character and go on your adventure.

If you're already in the adventure and you want to reload your latest changes, it's safe to just hit the "Reload" button. This will restart the adventure from the beginning, with no ill effect to your character.

### Special developer cheats

To make testing and debugging easier, there are a few special commands you can enter within the game:

Teleport to a specific room:

    GOTO {room number}
    e.g., GOTO 1
    
Open the JavaScript debugger:

    DEBUGGER
    
This lets you inspect the current game state using your browser's developer tools.
